## Overview

This project leverages the Polkadot network, Moonbeam parachain, and Solidity smart contracts to build a unified system for monitoring and visualizing transactions across different blockchains. By integrating these technologies, we aim to create a seamless experience for users to track transactions, identify potential scams, and visualize data effectively.

Try it for yourself with these wallet addresses:
- 0xeB5b7eE01F26B9adC088Ea2e3F66940e27414C92
- 0xe6d0ED3759709b743707DcfeCAe39BC180C981fe

## Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Tracking**: Monitor and analyze transactions across various blockchains using Polkadotâ€™s interoperability features.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Use interactive graphs to visualize transaction flows and relationships between addresses.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Deploy and interact with smart contracts on Moonbeam to manage and verify transactions.
- **User-Driven Credibility Scoring**: A unique smart contract allows users to vote and provide credibility scores for wallet addresses, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness in the ecosystem.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement features to detect and prevent fraudulent activities using data from Subscan and other sources.
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize Ethers.js to interact with blockchain data and provide detailed insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Polkadot Network**: Provides the multi-chain framework to enable interoperability between different blockchains.
- **Moonbeam Parachain**: Offers Ethereum compatibility, allowing for seamless integration with existing Ethereum-based tools and contracts.
- **Solidity**: Used for writing and deploying smart contracts on Moonbeam.
- **Subscan API**: Provides transaction data and analytics from the Polkadot network.
- **Ethers.js**: Facilitates interaction with blockchain data and smart contracts.

## Smart Contract for Credibility Voting

We have implemented a smart contract on Moonbeam that allows users to:

- **Vote on Wallet Addresses**: Users can cast votes to express their trust or concerns about specific wallet addresses.
- **Provide Credibility Scores**: The smart contract aggregates votes to calculate a credibility score for each wallet address, which is visible to all users.
- **Query and Display Scores**: Retrieve and display credibility scores in the PayPlot application to assist in decision-making and enhance transparency.

## Future Goals

Our vision is to expand this platform to connect more blockchains, offering a unified interface for tracking and visualizing transactions across various networks. By enhancing the interoperability and visualization capabilities, and introducing user-driven credibility scoring, we aim to improve transparency, prevent scams, and create a more integrated decentralized ecosystem.
